EVENT500065;To our north are our two German neighbors, waiting for the opportune moment to strike at us.

In the early 1970's (or earlier if all Boer cores are sieged) the Boer republic will declare independence in every state that has a province with Open Revolt. They will also get some troops for every province with Open Revolt. The German dictatorships to our north will join the Boers if they have not collapsed before then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVENT500066;The failure in World War 2 and the economic hardships our loss brought has lead to an increasing poverty gap between the southern and northern regions of our country. The tensions this has caused between the Afro-American and Dixie citizenry will inevitably lead to outright violence in these states. We do however have a chance to soften the impact of this. \n\n Jackson and Washington each start with their own modifiers representing racial tensions and federal desegregation efforts respectively. These will slowly spread throughout the south until every province is covered with one of them, at which point the provinces with racial tensions will fall into anarchy as racial violence erupts until military intervention arrives. \n Having a liberal party slows the spread of racial tension, while having at least 0.5% bureaucrats in a state will slow tension spread and speed up desegregation spread. \n Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cdn_focus_venezuela_title;Topple the Jimenez Dictatorship.;x
cdn_focus_venezuela_desc;The dictatorship of Perez Jimenez in neighboring Venezuela has long been a contentious point among the O.F.N. and South American democracies. Despite the concerns its neighbors have had about Venezuela's territorial claims and military juntas it has recieved ample support from the U.S.A. due to the special privileges American oil companies are allowed in the country. Through the lobbying of multiple free nations in the O.F.N. assembly we have a good chance of getting approval for a military intervention.;x

cbr_beef_title;Establish the British Empire Expeditionary Force.;x
cbr_beef_desc;The unification of the central countries of the British commonwealth has lead many to the expectation that the Commonwealth would continue on the reunify even the colonial possesions where British are the ethnic minority. None are more staunch proponents of this than Louis Mountbatten, the former Supreme Allied Commander of the Southeast Asia Command. Mountbatten served prestigiously in various naval commands in World War 2 and has many political connections among the exiled British monarchists due to being a close relative of the British royal family. With the collapse of India he has rallied many of his imperial supporters into advocating the establishment of the British Empire Expeditionary Force to restore the former colonial possesion. §R THE CB YOU WILL GET IS NOT FREE!!! IT COSTS 4 INFAMY DO NOT CRY ABOUT THINKING IT IS FREE!;x
